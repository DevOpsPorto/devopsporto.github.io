Because developing software is not enough, we like to discuss all DevOps related topics from the cultural perspective, such as communication and collaboration, and from the technical perspective, such as source control, continuous integration and continuous delivery. We're an open group interested in discussing topics related to applications, databases, infrastructure and human factors. So join us and share your thoughts!</i>
