                    conteúdos do WordPress. Em desenvolvimento há muitos meses, vem revolucionar a forma como criamos conteúdo
                    nos nossos sites. Para muito representa uma forma simples, prática e eficaz de criar conteúdo de forma
                    apelativa, visualmente agradável e rápida. Incluindo conteúdos visuais complexos, permitindo eliminar
                    a existência de um sistema do género 'page builder'. Para muitos outros, em particular programadores
                    de sites e aplicações complexas, representa um desafio. De uma forma ou outra, Gutenberg será um marco
                    determinante no futuro do WordPress. Mais um sinal da sua importância? O lançamento do WordPress 5 está
                    dependente da sua integração no core do sistema.
