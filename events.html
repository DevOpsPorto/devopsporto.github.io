As Data Science Portugal meetups return for another year full of events and surprises in the A.I. field, we start by bringing you live to one of the hottest debates: what is Tensorflow, and is it really Machine Learning?! Carlos Soares from University of Porto demonstrates why TensorFlow IS NOT machine learning and why Deep Learning might not be the best answer for every problem. Ricardo Teixeira from Talkdesk will share with us an overview of data lake architectures, their benefits, drawbacks and their usefulness to data scientists.<br/>
                    Wanna start this New DS Year on the right foot? This is it! Join us for another inspiring event at Porto and become part of the Data Science Portugal Community™! By the way... we have a fresh stock of B.E.E.R at your disposal

                    conteúdos do WordPress. Em desenvolvimento há muitos meses, vem revolucionar a forma como criamos conteúdo
                    nos nossos sites. Para muito representa uma forma simples, prática e eficaz de criar conteúdo de forma
                    apelativa, visualmente agradável e rápida. Incluindo conteúdos visuais complexos, permitindo eliminar
                    a existência de um sistema do género 'page builder'. Para muitos outros, em particular programadores
                    de sites e aplicações complexas, representa um desafio. De uma forma ou outra, Gutenberg será um marco
                    determinante no futuro do WordPress. Mais um sinal da sua importância? O lançamento do WordPress 5 está
                    dependente da sua integração no core do sistema.
