    <h1>DevOps Porto Speaker Process</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        We've got a simple process in place in order to validate talks that you may want to present.
    </p>
    <h2> Speaker code of conduct</h2>
    <p>
        We require that speakers not only follow the [community code-of-conduct] (codeofconduct.html) but also a small set of rules
        specific to presentations. In this case, talks should be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>relevant to the cultural and technical aspects of DevOps</li>
        <li>not be commercial in nature or desigend to influence a purchase in any form. We consider that talks require and benefit
            from presenting concrete products but should not look to sell the product.</li>
        <li>designed to respect the time limits associated to presentation slot</li>
        <li> regionaly exclusive up to 30 days before the event occurs, in order avoid repetition with it's presentation in other,
            local events in the same time frame.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Sign up form</h2>
    <p>
        Start by submitting our [Call for speakers form] (https://goo.gl/forms/LpS4noS5a3iA0vw83). This will have all the basic data
        related to your talk it will help us manage the process.
    </p>
    <h2> Once submitted</h2>
    <p>
        Once submitted, we'll look into fitting the submitted talks to the line up of meetups. Once we find the fit, we'll contact
        you for the follow up process which involves: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A presentation "pull-request" : we'll perform a presentaiton review, to aprove the talk contents, and provide any
            relevant feedback.</li>
        <li>Slide submission: we request that slides be submitted up to 2 weeks before the event for validation</li>
        <li> Bio submission: this will help us setup the host slides we use to introduce you to the community and event communication.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        This will help keep things organized well before the actual events occur and validate the relevance of the content for the
        community. Remebmber, also, that the organizers are a group of volunteers, so performing these actions in a timely
        fashion is obviously very helpfull.
