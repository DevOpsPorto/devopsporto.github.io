    <p>
        Like most community related organizations, we've decided to adopt a code of conduct for the organized activities. As such,
        we have decided to adopt the code of conduct brought forth by the Devopsdays community.
    </p>
    <h2> Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
        Respect and empathy are core devops values. DevOpsPorto is dedicated to providing an environment where everyone in the devops
        community can learn and share in respectful, considerate collaboration. We expect the organizer community before,
        during, and after the events to follow a similar code of conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
        DevOpsPorto is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for every participant, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
        disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or any other personal characteristics. We do not tolerate
        harassment of anyone in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any DevOpsPorto venue, including
        Slack, GitHub, and email. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the organization
        at the discretion of the core organizers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
        body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
        photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
        sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member
        of core organizers immediately.
