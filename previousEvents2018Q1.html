                    With agile methodologies adoption, database (and infrastructure) started to represent a bottleneck in the development process. To solve this problem concepts like Source Control, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery should be applied to database development in order to narrow the gap between applications and databases development.
                    
                    Our invited speaker, Eduardo Piairo (https://twitter.com/EdPiairo) will present a talk about the combination of the different moments of his agile journey through Scrum and Kanban and operations scope at different levels: database and application (and even infrastructure).</i>

As Data Science Portugal meetups return for another year full of events and surprises in the A.I. field, we start by bringing you live to one of the hottest debates: what is Tensorflow, and is it really Machine Learning?! Carlos Soares from University of Porto demonstrates why TensorFlow IS NOT machine learning and why Deep Learning might not be the best answer for every problem. Ricardo Teixeira from Talkdesk will share with us an overview of data lake architectures, their benefits, drawbacks and their usefulness to data scientists.<br/>

                    conteúdos do WordPress. Em desenvolvimento há muitos meses, vem revolucionar a forma como criamos conteúdo
                    nos nossos sites. Para muito representa uma forma simples, prática e eficaz de criar conteúdo de forma
                    apelativa, visualmente agradável e rápida. Incluindo conteúdos visuais complexos, permitindo eliminar
                    a existência de um sistema do género 'page builder'. Para muitos outros, em particular programadores
                    de sites e aplicações complexas, representa um desafio. De uma forma ou outra, Gutenberg será um marco
                    determinante no futuro do WordPress. Mais um sinal da sua importância? O lançamento do WordPress 5 está
                    dependente da sua integração no core do sistema.

                    Disruptive technologies like #Blockchain, #DataScience, #MachineLearning, #IoT and #NewManufacturing open new possibilities and push boundaries every day. They empower entrepreneurs to bring their solution to a scale and pace that was out of reach 3 years ago.
                    
                    We believe that a technology-first approach to solve the XXIth century challenges is a risk if taken in isolation from the local contact and the specifics of the user.
                    
                    This is why we need to spark-up collaboration from the need on the field to the algorithm.
