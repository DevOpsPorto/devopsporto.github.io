            <h3>Turbocharging Azure DevOps with Octopus Deploy</h3>
            {% include components/speakerhandle.html name="Derek Campbell"  twitter="DevOpsDerek"%}
            <p>
              Often, organizations and members of the Dev and Ops teams have automated the build & test but still, 
              need to deploy manually and often out of hours. Azure DevOps and Octopus Deploy go together like cheese and 
              crackers and are easily integrated and can be used to deploy to Azure IaaS & PaaS and also on-Premise.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this session, Derek will take you through how to integrate Azure DevOps and Octopus Deploy using the extension. 
              He will then configure an Azure pipeline and lastly pass this through to Octopus Deploy which will then deploy to 
              Azure from a single build and test all the way to Production.
            </p>
