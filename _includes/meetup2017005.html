            <p>
              Not having the ability to know exactly how your production system behaves can be costly - both in terms of missed
              opportunities as well as recovery time when disaster strikes. However, the overall complexity of today's systems
              and their interactions makes it ever more difficult to have visibility into their health and performance.</p>
            <p>
              Our invited speaker Pedro Araújo (@phcrva) will explore the various facets of monitoring and how combining them can lead
              you from operational blindness to effective observability.</p>
