                        <p>How developer documentation is created and managed at Talkdesk, an API-first company.
                            Talkdesk follows a software development strategy that is focused on allowing partners and
                            customers to integrate with its systems in a customized, easy, and flexible way.
                            APIs are a key element in this approach. And this requires structured and well-written
                            developer documentation so that Talkdesk's customers can learn how to use its APIs.
