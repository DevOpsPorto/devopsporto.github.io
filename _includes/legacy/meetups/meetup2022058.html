                        <h3>Cloud Cost Optimization</h3>

                        <p>Cloud computing is great. Providers do the heavy lifting of data center operations like
                            racking, stacking, cabling, powering servers, and ensuring that all their services are
                            delivered in the most reliable way. It allows companies to minimize infrastructure up-front
                            costs and provides burst computing capability. But cloud costs can escalate rapidly due to
                            poor practices. This presentation will give some actionable insights on how to optimize
                            cloud computing costs.</p>

                        <h3>Using Jupyter Notebooks for automation and knowledge sharing</h3>

                        <p>Jupyter is a very well-known tool in the data science and machine learning communities, but
                            its flexibility to hold text and runnable code together in the same document allows its
                            usage in many different scenarios. In this talk, we will discuss how we have been using this
                            tool to automate DevOps tasks and in doing so how we enabled sharing of knowledge on DevOps
                            topics within our team.
