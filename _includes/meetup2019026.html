            <h3>DevOps Adoption at Meo TV</h3>
            {% include components/speakerhandle.html name="Cristina Moura Rebelo" linkedin="crismr" twitter="CrisMR"%}

            <p>
              Deploying and maintaining any TV service brings along a specific set of challenges that can be either
              overwhelming or game-changing. How did DevOps help us turn the table and what do we still need to figure
              out? We will share this journey with you, its obstacles and findings altogether. And some leadership tips
              too.

            <h3>(A Brief) DevOps History at EDP</h3>
            {% include components/speakerhandle.html name="Sergio Amorim" linkedin="saamorim" %}

            <p>
              DevOps in an enterprise company is not easy, but it is possible! In this talk I’ll present the brief
              DevOps History at EDP, one of the largest companies in Portugal. Either in cloud systems or in traditional
              legacy systems, every path should take you to a high throughput system. I’ll take with you through our
              journey, showing you our path, and what we did to overcome some of the obstacles. Hopefully, after this
              session, you will know how to avoid our mistakes and replicate our successes.
            </p>

            <h4>Sérgio Amorim:</h4>
            <p>
              Sérgio Amorim works in EDP as the head of DevOps CoE. He is responsible for the DevOps implementation,
              changing the way how software is constructed, built, deployed, and operated. With the help of a framework,
              some tools but mostly through coaching the devops movement is starting to take shape, which will help the
              DevOps teams produce better software and, in turn, help the business get better value.
