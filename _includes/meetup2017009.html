            <p>
              As we all know, "human error" is the default response for almost every accident. But the 
              "human error" explanation is just too shallow and simplistic. It only satisfies one of the 
              four needs of a good accident analysis: the moral one. Join us to learn why we should get 
              rid of the "human error" fallacy, what are those four needs and how we can make the most 
              of an accident... as they will happen one day, just like death and taxes.

            <h4>About Jo達o:</h4>
            <p>
              Jo達o started his career in 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble. That enlightening experience led him to the 
              conclusion that agile practices (and now DevOps) are the best way to respond to the business needs of almost all 
              organizations. He currently is IT manager at a large portuguese bank, where he helps to remove all friction that 
              may hinder development teams fast pace.
