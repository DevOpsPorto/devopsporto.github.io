            <p>
              This time around we will hosting Dave Farley (@davefarley77), the well known thought leader and co-author of the seminal book <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html" target="_blank">"Continuous Delivery"</a> and the <a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Reactive Manifesto"</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Writing and maintaining a suite of acceptance tests that can give you a high level of confidence in the behaviour and configuration of your system is a complex task. In this talk Dave will describe approaches to acceptance testing that allow teams to: work quickly and effectively; build excellent functional coverage for complex enterprise-scale systems; manage and maintain those tests in the face of change, and of evolution in both the codebase and the understanding of the business problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              This talk will answer the following questions, and more: How do you fail fast? How do you make your testing scalable? How do you isolate test cases from one-another? How do you maintain a working body of tests when you radically change the interface to your system?
            </p>
