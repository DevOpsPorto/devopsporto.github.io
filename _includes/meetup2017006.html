            <h3>Security in the wild</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Renato Rodriques</strong> <small><a href="https://twitter.com/simps0n">@simpsOn</a></small>
            </p>
            <p>
              With 0xOPOSEC (@oposec) community as partner, we are happy and grateful for having Renato Rodrigues (@simps0n) as invited
              speaker. For Renato and for a modern software house, security is a top priority. It is a fast-paced working
              environment focused on continuous delivery and integration. Keeping up is an endless and demanding challenge
              for the security team. Issues arise and must be addressed efficiently and in an expedited manner. Besides keeping
              abreast with emerging technology, the team needs to develop strategies that ultimately work within the organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Can classic analysis tools be used on a strict time cycle? How can a security team handle the demands of a product team?
              How to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands what’s under the hood? In seeking answers to
              these questions, this talk assembles a set of tips and tricks by showing some work and spikes used in a real
              software house. One hopes to provide a potential roadmap for the implementation of secure and improved Software
              Developing Life Cycles.
            </p>
