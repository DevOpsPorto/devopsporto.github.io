              Over the past 8 years, the DevOps movement was the stimulant to create a large number of new tools, lots of them open source, 
              some not. A large number of those tools got announced as the ultimate #devops tool, think about Puppet, Chef, Vagrant, Docker, 
              Kubernetes etc. and a lot of the developers and operations folks jumped on these tools. Often, even to a point where the tool was 
              more important than the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then came the idea of the Full Stack engineer.. like the person who does kernel development, front-end development and everything 
              in between.
            </p>
            <p>
              But now it's time for the Dull Stack Engineer, the Engineer who knows what's running on his platform, focusses on servicing the 
              business and not just his need of new and fancy tooling, the engineer who collaborates with his peers rather than running Docker 
              because it's the cool thing to do..
            </p>
