            <p>
                With agile methodologies adoption, database (and infrastructure) started to represent a bottleneck in the development process. 
                To solve this problem concepts like Source Control, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery should be applied to 
                database development in order to narrow the gap between applications and databases development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our invited speaker will present a talk about the combination of the different moments of his agile journey through Scrum and 
                Kanban and operations scope at different levels: database and application (and even infrastructure).                
            </p>
