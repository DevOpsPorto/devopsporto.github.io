            <p>
              Continuous learning is essential to all knowledge workers, especially IT pros who are key stakeholders in an industry where tech is constantly changing and evolving. 
              How that learning happens varies from person to person, and company to company. Work activities, personal lives and general firefighting often leave our 
              learning tasks on the backlog of life. Also, unfortunately, not every company invests adequately in training, which only helps promote skill obseletion.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this talk, Miguel will remind you the importance of learning and skill development and look to challenge you to ramp up your learning habits in 2018. 
              He'll offer some topics to look into next year and offer some tips to help follow through with that effort that have helped him along his own career.

              He's a proponent of TDD as a development practice, very fond of microservices, and of automating as much as possible in every part of the 
              product pipeline. Finding ways to augment individual and team learning experiences is a special interest of his. He hopes to someday bring some life back into his blog at <a href="http://www.miguelalho.pt" _target="_blank">miguelalho.pt</a>
