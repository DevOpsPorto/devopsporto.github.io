              Full-time, 13-years-in-the-making, software engineer with a DevOps and Craftsmanship mindset. Previously,
              I worked mainly as a dev freelancer, but also as a consultant, school teacher, media producer and project

              I'm a very big fan of TDD as a development practice, very fond of microservices, of automating as much as
              possible in the dev, build and deploy pipeline, but also in finding ways to augment individual and team
              learning experiences.

              with a background on Test Automation tools and also Infrastructure. I believe that tools are nothing

              people interact and communicate helps to overcome any problem in software development. I'm always trying
              to build an interactive culture with the help of new testing tools and pipelines that work together with
              processes to make everyone happy and more productive in their jobs!
