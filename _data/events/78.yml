      Writing Code with Machines (AI)
    abstract: |
      1 - What is AI really about?
      AIs are becoming part of the development world, but most people still misunderstand what they actually are. Before we can work with them effectively, we need to separate hype from reality.

      2 - How is AI entering the software development loop?
      Developers are already writing code with machines. Through a small real-world demo, we’ll build and test a project using AI tools to experience the shift firsthand.

      3 - What is the impact of AI on software development?
      AI is changing more than just productivity. It’s transforming how we think about quality, collaboration, and even the role of the developer. This shift forces us to rethink not only how we write code, but how we define software delivery.

      4 - What’s next?
      If today we’re writing code with machines, what will tomorrow look like? Are we becoming prompt engineers? AI architects? How do we stay relevant, skilled, and in control in this fast-changing landscape?
