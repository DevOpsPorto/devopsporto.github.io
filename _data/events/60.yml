    title: Secure Remote Access Without a VPN
    abstract:
      Securely accessing remote resources is a problem that every company faces, and many solutions already exist.


      This talk will explain why and how we used one of Hashicorp's latest tools, Boundary
      (https://www.boundaryproject.io), to allow secure remote access without a VPN or a
      traditional jump host.
