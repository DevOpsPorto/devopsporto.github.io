    title: Optimizing MLOps Costs - Tackling Kubernetes Challenges
    abstract:
      While presenting on this topic, I will go over the demands of machine learning workloads on Kubernetes and review the best strategies to optimize costs. I will address common issues like overprovisioning, where allocating excess resources leads to inflated expenses, and share methods to right-size resource allocation. My talk also highlights the overlooked costs of data movement, as transferring large datasets between cloud storage and compute nodes can quickly escalate expenses during frequent model retraining.

      This talk provides actionable suggestions, tools, and practical examples to make their MLOps initiatives more efficient and cost-effective. And it will be useful not only for Engineers working supporting MLOps teams but also for any DevOps/Infrastructure engineer looking to enhance K8s cloud resources setup (my demo will be leveraging examples using EKS).
