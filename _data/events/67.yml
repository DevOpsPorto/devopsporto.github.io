    title: eBPF - Why is everyone talking about it and what does it mean to you?
    abstract:
      eBPF has been in the spotlight for a few years. More people talk about it, more tools use it, and more companies deploy it. But what does it mean to you?

      eBPF is complex and most people won't learn how to write eBPF programs. However, people should understand its high-level architecture, its benefits and limitations, and in which areas it should be used.
      
      This talk starts with an elucidation of what eBPF is and the challenges it addresses. Next, it delves into the key areas that are making the most of eBPF, such as Observability, Security, and so forth. We'll highlight various tools that enable you to benefit from eBPF without the need to write an eBPF program yourself. To wrap things up, we are going to run a demo. Here, we'll break down the notorious Log4Shell vulnerability, stage an attack exploiting it, and teach you how to detect such a breach.
