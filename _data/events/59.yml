    title: Managing API Documentation at a Decacorn
    abstract:
      How developer documentation is created and managed at Talkdesk, an API-first company.
      Talkdesk follows a software development strategy that is focused on allowing partners and
      customers to integrate with its systems in a customized, easy, and flexible way.
      APIs are a key element in this approach. And this requires structured and well-written
      developer documentation so that Talkdesk's customers can learn how to use its APIs.
