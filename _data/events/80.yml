      1: Configure an API Management Platform with K8s and GitOps
    abstract: >
      Due to regulatory requirements, Geo Distribution or internal Architectural decisions, it's not uncommon for a DevOps team to operate multiple API Management instances within a single organization. When operating at scale, standardization and automation become critical to maintain consistency and efficiency.
      In this talk, using a GitOps Pull model (powered by ArgoCD), we will explore an approach for configuring multiple API Management Platforms. By extending Kubernetes API and using Kubernetes Operators, we ensure that each API Management platform's actual state aligns with its desired state in a fully automated and declarative manner.
