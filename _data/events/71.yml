  title: Ship your dev environment to CI
  abstract: 
    "Imagine having a consistent, reliable environment for your CI that mirrors your local setup perfectly. In this session, we'll explore how to create and ship Dagger pipelines written in Go that seamlessly: Orchestrate builds, Run tests, Deploy applications.
    All within a unified environment, ensuring your pipelines run identically â€” whether locally or on your preferred CI provider.
    Discover Dagger, an open-source, portable, and programmable CI/CD engine that leverages containers to deliver consistency and portability for your workflows. See how Dagger can transform the way you build, test, and deploy!"
