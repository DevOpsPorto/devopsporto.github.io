      Automating Cloud Data Infrastructure: terraform meets CI/CD and DevOps
    abstract: >
      In this session, I’ll share my experience implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
      using Terraform and integrating it into a CI/CD pipeline to automate cloud data infrastructure,
      all while discovering and taking my first deep dive into the world of DevOps.
      I’ll go through some of these topics, sharing knowledge and give examples.
