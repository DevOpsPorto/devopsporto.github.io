    title: FinOps - Balancing Cloud Innovation with Cost Optimization
    abstract:
      Grupo Lusiaves was one of the first companies in Portugal to go full Public Cloud back by the end of 2017. With a continuous push to innovate, the group had to balance business needs with cost optimization of Cloud services harder to predict, control, and understand.
