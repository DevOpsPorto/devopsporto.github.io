    title: The way devs do ops - or is it the other way around?
    abstract:
      Our invited speaker is Miguel Fonseca (<a href="https://twitter.com/miguelcnf">@miguelcnf</a>) and his talk will
      explore the foundations of any modern software project in order to achieve full DevOps awesomeness, how developers
      and operations can speak the same language, and three main rules to build software by or burn out trying. Expect
      to see certain amounts of code.
