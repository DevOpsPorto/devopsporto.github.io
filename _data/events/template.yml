    title: The (un)surprising truth about DevOps culture
    abstract:
      This will be our 1st meetup about DevOps and its culture, practices and techniques, and will be co-organized with our partners Agile Connect community (their 7th meetup). Join us in building "bridges" between development and operations.  
      

      For this session we have invited Manuel Pais, who will share with us his insights on what DevOps culture is all about, and what you can do to improve collaboration in your team.<
      

      This talk will tell you about all the right practices you need to adopt to become a successful DevOps organization!
      

      DevOps is highly contextual, there is no set of prescribed practices that an organization can pick up and “become DevOps”.


      So what “can” you do? Attend this talk to find out!
