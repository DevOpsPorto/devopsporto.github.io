      Simplifying Cloud-Native Applications with Radius: A Developer and IT Approach to Multi-Cloud
    abstract: >
      As cloud computing continues to accelerate innovation, many companies are building increasingly complex, cloud-native applications that span multiple public clouds and private infrastructures.
      While Kubernetes has paved the way for portability and scalability, its complexity and lack of a formal application definition have created challenges for developers and IT teams.
      Managing applications composed of numerous interconnected services—and ensuring they meet corporate standards for cost, operations, and security—requires a new approach.

      Project Radius, developed by the Azure Incubations Team, was designed to address these challenges by providing a unified, open-source platform that simplifies cloud-native application management and enhances multi-cloud compatibility.
      Radius builds on top of Kubernetes, working with familiar tools like Terraform, Bicep, and GitHub Actions, to streamline the development and deployment process. Unlike Kubernetes alone,
      Radius recognizes the full scope of an application, connecting components, managing dependencies, and automating essential tasks like setting permissions and configuring connections.
      In this session, we’ll explore Radius’s architecture and design, focusing on how it empowers both developers and IT teams to collaborate efficiently and adopt cloud-native best practices by default.
      Whether you’re running applications on Azure, other clouds, or on-premises, Radius offers a powerful, developer-friendly solution for simplifying application management, ensuring compliance, and accelerating cloud adoption.
