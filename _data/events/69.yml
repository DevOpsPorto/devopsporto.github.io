    title: Imposter Syndrome - We’re together on this
    abstract:
      Do you have the feeling that you’re fooling people around about how much do you know about something? Or maybe you think that you don’t deserve the compliments people give you? You probably suffer from Imposter Syndrome and you’re not alone on that, how about we talk about it?
    
      Imposter syndrome is a phenomenon that affects aprox. 70% of the well succeeded, being more strong on women.

      We’ll discuss (among other stuff) what it is, how it affects us and how to help people who suffer from it (including ourselves)
