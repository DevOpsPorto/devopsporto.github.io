      You Can’t Fix What You Can’t See: Tales from the Observability Frontier
    abstract: >
      Observability isn’t a tool — it’s a strategy. This talk brings together three seasoned engineers to discuss how to design an observability setup that scales with your system and your team.
      We’ll explore architectural patterns, and discuss our ideal observability setups, so you know what to be in the lookout for our observability journey.
      Also, the human side of observability — onboarding, alert fatigue, and cross-team visibility. Whether you’re a platform engineer or a tech lead, you’ll leave with actionable insights.
